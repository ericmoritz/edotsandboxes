This tutorial builds a massively multiplayer board game in Erlang and
HTML5.

The game is based on the old pen and paper game, [dots and
boxes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_and_Boxes).

The premise of the game is fairly simple (from Wikipedia):

> Starting with an empty grid of dots, players take turns, adding a
> single horizontal or vertical line between two unjoined adjacent
> dots. A player who completes the fourth side of a 1Ã—1 box earns one
> point and takes another turn. (The points are typically recorded by
> placing in the box an identifying mark of the player, such as an
> initial). The game ends when no more lines can be placed. The winner
> of the game is the player with the most points.
